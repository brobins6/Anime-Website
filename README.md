# Anime-Website
beginner level website creation for my concepts class using JQuery, HTML, and javascript

what this program accomplishes is that you are able to add new anime queries to the anime database, able to see the top 10 anime from my list,
and able to see a random anime from the database.

Also what i was able to accomplish in this program was able to use the JQuery functions in order to hide and show information in the same 
spot by clicking a button.
